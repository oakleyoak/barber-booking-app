# üÜï Recent Features & Improvements (2025)

- **15-Minute Appointment Slots**: All booking components now use 15-minute intervals for appointments, allowing for more precise scheduling.
- **Dynamic Owner Earnings Calculation**: The owner's share from staff is now dynamically calculated based on each staff member's commission rate (Owner Share = 100% - Staff Commission Rate). No more hardcoded percentages.
- **Per-Employee Earnings Breakdown**: Owners can view a detailed breakdown of earnings per employee, including the owner's share and a review option for each staff member.
- **Admin Panel Restricted to Owner**: Only users with the 'Owner' role can access the admin panel. Managers and other roles are denied access.
- **Live Commission Rate Updates**: Changes to staff commission rates in the admin panel are immediately reflected in all earnings calculations and owner shares.
- **Accessibility Improvements**: All form elements and buttons in the admin panel now include proper labels, placeholders, and titles for improved accessibility.
- **Real-Time Supabase Sync for Earnings**: All earnings, owner and staff breakdowns, and summaries now pull directly from the Supabase `bookings` table for 100% live data accuracy. No more stale or missing figures.
- **Bugfixes**: Fixed issues where detailed earnings and staff breakdowns showed zero due to out-of-sync transaction logic. All breakdowns now match the live bookings data.
